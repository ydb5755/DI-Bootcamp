# Instructions:
Build a lesson page for the di-learning platform !

1. Create a directory called lesson1.

1. Inside the directory there should be 2 markdown files (.md) : in-this-chapter.md and exercises.md. The first file in-this-chapter.md should contain a lesson of your choice. The second file exercises.md should contain exercises (it can be yours or it can be from the platform).
    - Hint: Markdown Crash Course
    - Check out the markdown documentation.

1. Create 2 routes :
    - /exercises will render the exercises.md file
    - /lesson will render the in-this-chapter.md file.

1. BONUS : Display the content of the md files in two different tabs in one HTML file.
