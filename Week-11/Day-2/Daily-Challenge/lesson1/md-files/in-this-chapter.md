# Web Development With Python - Overview
Python is well-known within the programming sphere as being deceptively easy to learn and understand. This is due to a combination of factors, primary among which is the considerable practical ease of usage, as it requires fewer lines of code to do more, as compared to its more traditional counterparts. This usability has allowed some of the biggest websites to be developed with this language.

## Flask
Flask is a smaller framework; coming into the micro-framework territory. Being so, it is best for small-scale web application development. It is also newer, containing features such as built-in web development server and unit testing. These features allow programmers to create efficient and reliable web applications.

## Django
Django is by far the most popular and commonly used Python framework. Aimed at the development of larger-scale web applications, Django contains all the necessary features that a programmer could need in their web application development suite. These features come as part of the framework bundle. Tasks such as templating, authentication, routing and database administration are not necessary with the Django framework, despite which you can create some of the most comprehensive and interactive applications.
