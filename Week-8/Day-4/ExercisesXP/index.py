# üåü Exercise 1 : Pets
# Instructions
# Using this code:

# class Pets():
#     def __init__(self, animals):
#         self.animals = animals

#     def walk(self):
#         for animal in self.animals:
#             print(animal.walk())

# class Cat():
#     is_lazy = True

#     def __init__(self, name, age):
#         self.name = name
#         self.age = age

#     def walk(self):
#         return f'{self.name} is just walking around'

# class Bengal(Cat):
#     def sing(self, sounds):
#         return f'{sounds}'

# class Chartreux(Cat):
#     def sing(self, sounds):
#         return f'{sounds}'


# Create another cat breed named Siamese which inherits from the Cat class.
# Create a list called all_cats, which holds three cat instances : one Bengal, one Chartreux and one Siamese.
# Those three cats are Sara‚Äôs pets. Create a variable called sara_pets which value is an instance of the Pet class, and pass the variable all_cats to the new instance.
# Take all the cats for a walk, use the walk method.

# class Siamese(Cat):
#     def sing(self, sounds):
#         return f'{sounds}'

# bingo = Bengal('bingo', 2)
# bango = Chartreux('bango',5)
# bongo = Siamese('bongo',10)
# all_cats = [bingo,bango,bongo]
# sara_pets = Pets(all_cats)
# sara_pets.walk()

# üåü Exercise 2 : Dogs
# Instructions
# Create a class called Dog with the following attributes name, age, weight.
# Implement the following methods in the Dog class:
# bark: returns a string which states: ‚Äú<dog_name> is barking‚Äù.
# run_speed: returns the dogs running speed (weight/age*10).
# fight : takes a parameter which value is another Dog instance, called other_dog. This method returns a string stating which dog won the fight. The winner should be the dog with the higher run_speed x weight.

# Create 3 dogs and run them through your class.

class Dog():
    def __init__(self, name, age, weight):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.weight = weight
        self.power = self.run_speed()*self.weight
    
    def bark(self):
        return f'{self.name} is barking'
    
    def run_speed(self):
        return (self.weight/(self.age*10))
    
    def fight(self, other_dog):
        if self.power > other_dog.power:
            return f'{self.name} is the winner!'
        else:
            return f'{other_dog.name} is the winner!'
        
reggie = Dog('reggie', 4, 15)
ronald = Dog('ronald', 2, 10)
ruby = Dog('ruby', 7, 30)

# print(reggie.run_speed())

# üåü Exercise 3 : Dogs Domesticated
# Instructions
# Create a new python file and import your Dog class from the previous exercise.
# In the new python file, create a class named PetDog that inherits from Dog.
# Add an attribute called trained to the __init__ method, this attribute is a boolean and the value should be False by default.
# Add the following methods:
# train: prints the output of bark and switches the trained boolean to True

# play: takes a parameter which value is a few names of other Dog instances (use *args). The method should print the following string: ‚Äúdog_names all play together‚Äù.

# do_a_trick: If the dog is trained the method should print one of the following sentences at random:
# ‚Äúdog_name does a barrel roll‚Äù.
# ‚Äúdog_name stands on his back legs‚Äù.
# ‚Äúdog_name shakes your hand‚Äù.
# ‚Äúdog_name plays dead‚Äù.
