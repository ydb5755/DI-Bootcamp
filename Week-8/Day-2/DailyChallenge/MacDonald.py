# Take a look at the following code and output:
# File: market.py

# macdonald = Farm("McDonald")
# macdonald.add_animal('cow',5)
# macdonald.add_animal('sheep')
# macdonald.add_animal('sheep')
# macdonald.add_animal('goat', 12)
# print(macdonald.get_info())
# Output

# McDonald's farm

# cow : 5
# sheep : 2
# goat : 12

#     E-I-E-I-0!


# Create the code that is needed to receive the result provided above. Below are a few questions to assist you with your code:

# Create a class called Farm. How should it be implemented?
# Does the Farm class need an __init__ method? If so, what parameters should it take?
# How many methods does the Farm class need?
# Do you notice anything interesting about the way we are calling the add_animal method? What parameters should this function have? How manyâ€¦?
# Test your code and make sure you get the same results as the example above.
# Bonus: nicely line the text in columns as seen in the example above. Use string formatting.


class Farm:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.animals = {}
        self.name = name
    def add_animal(self, name:str, amount:int = 1): # you can make this function in just a single line: self.animals[name] = self.animals.get(name, 0) + amount
        if name in self.animals.keys():
            self.animals[name] = self.animals[name] + amount
        else:
            self.animals[name] = amount
    def get_info(self):
        return f'{self.name}\n\n{self.animals}\n\n\tE-I-E-I-O'

macdonald = Farm("McDonald")
macdonald.add_animal('cow',5)
macdonald.add_animal('sheep')
macdonald.add_animal('sheep')
macdonald.add_animal('goat', 12)
